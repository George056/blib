# blib

## Author
George Cook   

## Description
This is a library that I am making with useful tools based on the STL and dlib. It will have my implementations of these data structures and algorithms. I am doing this both for fun and to remember what I have learned (and test myself).

## Contents

All container types are found within the Containers directory. Including Containers.h will include all containers.   

Math.h will contain useful tools for doing mathematical operations, both in the form of algorithms and data types.   

Memory.hpp will contain "smart pointers" and a memory management system.   

## Note
I will be working on this in my free time to it may not be updated frequently.   

The working repository for the containers can be found at https://github.com/George056/G-Data-Structures
