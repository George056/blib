# blib

## Author
George Cook   

## Description
This is a library that I am making with useful tools based on the STL and dlib. It will have my implementations of these data structures and algorithms. I am doing this both for fun and to remember what I have learned (and test myself).

## Contents

All container types are found within the Containers directory. Including Containers.h will include all containers.   

Math.h will contain useful tools for doing mathematical operations, both in the form of algorithms and data types.   

Memory.hpp will contain "smart pointers" and a memory management system.   

## Pair

Pair is made and based on the stl implementation of pair.   

## Math

Math contains the mathematical constructs.   
Complex is used to store complex numbers within the Cartesian plane (a + bi). It contains the \_i used to make a complex literal. It is also in the process of
having the polar representation of complex numbers being added.   
Functions contains a multitude of functions that are expected to be in <cmath>.   
Constants contains useful constants such as pi and e, as well as some efficency based constants (most are also seen in the stl).   
Matrix is used to store matrices and peform matrix operations.   
Similarly exists Vector to perform the same operations.   

## Note
I will be working on this in my free time to it may not be updated frequently.
